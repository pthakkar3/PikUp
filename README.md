## Getting Started - Install Guide

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local emulator for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies:
Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the link below. Follow the prompts.
```
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
```

### Download Instructions:
Download the zip of our project from GitHub and extract it somewhere you can find it. <br />
Launch Android Studio and open PikUp by navigating to File -> Open Project and selecting PikUp.<br />
Android Studio should recognize that PikUp is an Android Project when you are selecting it and display an Android icon while the file directory is open.<br />

### Build Instructions:
Android Studio should automatically attempt to build the project when you open the project.<br />
Alternatively, you can navigate to Build -> Make Project in the toolbar or press the hammer icon in the iconbar below the toolbar.<br />

### Install/Run Instructions:
After a successful build, you can run the application by navigating to Run -> Run App in the toolbar or by pressing the green play button in the iconbar.<br />
Android Studio will then display a screen showing all the devices you can run the application on.<br />
Here, you have two options:<br />
 1. Connect your own Android device with USB debugging turned on in Developer Settings, or <br />
 2. Create a new Virtual Device that will run on the emulator provided by Android Studio (You may have to install some software based on the virtual device settings you choose.) <br />
Android Studio will then run the application on your selected device.
                            
Please allow the emulator some time to boot up and get started; the emulator itself is a heavy application and may take some time to load.

### Trouble Shooting:
Android Studio uses Gradle to build the project, so if you do not already have Gradle installed, Android Studio may request to install it for you.<br />
We recommend that you accept and install the latest version of Gradle if Android Studio suggests it to you, as it is vital in building the application.<br />
