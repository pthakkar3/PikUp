## Getting Started - Install Guide

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local emulator for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites and Dependencies:
Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the link below. Follow the prompts.
```
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
```

### Download Instructions:
Download the zip of our project from GitHub and extract it somewhere you can find it. 
Launch Android Studio and open PikUp by navigating to File -> Open Project and selecting PikUp.
Android Studio should recognize that PikUp is an Android Project when you are selecting it and display an Android icon while the file directory is open.

### Build Instructions:
Android Studio should automatically attempt to build the project when you open the project.
Alternatively, you can navigate to Build -> Make Project in the toolbar or press the hammer icon in the iconbar below the toolbar.

### Install/Run Instructions:
After a successful build, you can run the application by navigating to Run -> Run App in the toolbar or by pressing the green play button in the iconbar.
Android Studio will then display a screen showing all the devices you can run the application on.
Here, you have two options: 1. Connect your own Android device with USB debugging turned on in Developer Settings, or
                            2. Create a new Virtual Device that will run on the emulator provided by Android Studio (You may have to install some software based on the virtual device settings you choose.)
Android Studio will then run the application on your selected device.
                            
Please allow the emulator some time to boot up and get started; the emulator itself is a heavy application and may take some time to load.

### Trouble Shooting:
Android Studio uses Gradle to build the project, so if you do not already have Gradle installed, Android Studio may request to install it for you.
We recommend that you accept and install the latest version of Gradle if Android Studio suggests it to you, as it is vital in building the application.
